With emerging technology in continuous evolution over the last few years, we have seen the emergence of the term smart agriculture. 
Although AI and conventional IoT techniques are already transforming the world of precision smart farming for many years, 
the challenge has been in moving from powerful specialist platforms with delayed processing of data especially for rural areas to processing and acting in real-time. 
The conventional method is not adaptable because of poor internet connectivity and high cost. 
"Smart Farming with EDGE-AI based Intelligence Cloud" solves many of the real-world challenges, out in the field. 
Edge computing will enable the swift transfer of data to the cloud so that real-time analytics and machine-to-machine communication can streamline and automate the farming process, which will help to connect rural areas. 
The approach is to implement a system consist of sensor nodes with data acquisition, Edge gateway with indigenous RISC-V processor, EDGE-AI based public cloud and global connecting interfaces for robust data analytics. 
The results of using indigenous RISC-V based processor and EDGE computing will make the solution more affordable, accessible and scalable.
